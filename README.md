# DS_UA-301-Final-Project

Multi-class Classification of book covers to predict the categories of the books.  
This project imports image data and trians sequential model through tensorflow to classify the book covers directly.  
And it converts the titles to vectors and use RNN, LSTM, and GRU model to predict the categories.  
It also uses python-tesseract, which is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool for Python, to detect the letters of the title in the book cover and use them to predict their categories with RNN model.
